These are files for the Data Incubator challenge problem submission

Matlab files are to solve Problem 1 (random walk)
There is a brute force code for sanity check and a long script that uses Markov chains to solve exactly

The python code big_data_file.py is used to analyze the NYC311 file (Problem 2), I did not finish much of this

Proposal.docx details the proposed project fro the Data Incubator (Problem 3)

The other python codes are for getting weather info from Weather Underground
get_historical_weather.py attempts to scrape historical data but there was one line I could not get working using BeautifulSoup
get_weather_api.py uses an API to get the temperature and rain forecast for 4 cities and generate plots
Samples of these plots are also incuded as png files
